      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p><br>My journey of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web design is a tale filled with challenges, triumphs, and immense growth. It began with a spark of curiosity and evolved into a passionate endeavor to master the foundational languages of the web.
        <br><br>In the next couple of web pages, I explain what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the period of my ISP.<br><br>The journey of mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an ongoing process. The web is ever-evolving, with new frameworks, libraries, and best practices constantly emerging. What started as a simple foray into web design has blossomed into a continuous journey of learning, adaptation, and embracing new technologies like React, Vue, and Angular, while understanding the significance of performance and accessibility.

        This journey has transformed me from a novice into a confident web designer and developer, capable of creating engaging, responsive, and dynamic web experiences. It's a testament to my determination, curiosity, and the sheer joy of creating something out of nothing. Although the journey is far from over, each line of code, each project, and each challenge I overcome is a step forward on this ever-evolving path of web development.  </p>
